## Aim of the project 1:
> In this project, an ETH dataset can be accessed through codespace and webservice via click script and microservice fastapi. By using the tool I provide, users can pull the recent ETH transactions information from the dataset uploaded to databricks.
## Dataset settings:
The dataset embedded is downloaded from Kaggle called Ethereum Transactions (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blessontomjoseph/ethereum-transactions). ETH is a cryptocurrency which uses blockchain technology and achieves a distributed transaction. Via the tool provided by me, any users can have free access to the most recent ETH transactions.
